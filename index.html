                <h5>It is important to take care of your mental and physical health while playing video games.<br>Sometimes players get mind-blocks because of constantly losing games and/or losing their<br> temper. This raises blood pressure, and having blood pressure that is<br> consistently high is unhealthy for your body.In other situations, being in front of screens<br> for a long period of time is bad for your eyes, and constantly being in a chair takes an<br> unhealthy toll on your body. So, it is important to take breaks and keep yourself in check. </h5>
