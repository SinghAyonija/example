            <h2>PC (Personal Computer) / Laptops</h2>
            <h3>To play on a PC, which stands for Personal Computer, you need good basic components.</h3>
            <h4>Like: CPU, GPU, Motherboard, Memory(RAM), Storage, PSU, System Cooling, and<br> other COMPATABLE Gaming peripherals.</h4>
            <h3>To know more aboout PCs and where to start click <a href="https://www.cnn.com/cnn-underscored/electronics/beginner-gaming-pc">HERE</a>.</h3>
            <h5>From the author personally, GRAPHICS CARD is the most important component. <br>Frames per minute being low really handicaps gamers during gaming sessions.</h5>
            <h5>To find out where to pick your parts out for your very own PC<br>check out <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/">PC Part Picker.</a><br>It is very useful and will show you which parts are compatable<br> and which arent, and classifies the components in a very organized way.</h5>

            <h2>Consoles</h2>
            <h3>Consoles, similar to PCs, are pretty common among the gaming community.</h3>
            <h4>Consoles include: Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo Switch, Wii and many more.</h4>

            <h2>Mobile</h2>
            <h3 class="mobile">Mobile gamers are the most common type of gamers, yet are made fun<br> of the most. They are underrated. Lots of good games like Subway Surfers,<br>Temple Run, Among us, Pok√©mon Go, and Genshin Impact are all<br> mainly played on mobile and are quite fun.</h3>
